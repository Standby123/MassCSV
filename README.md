# MassCSV
MassCSV is a free, open source tool similar in function to Matlab. It can manage large CSV files for plotting and Fourier transforms with noise filtering and datetime compatibility. It is based in python so is easy to customise and add on to. There's probably many issues so feel free to email and I'll see if I can sort anything out.
